### sawtelle (yum yum)

every ucla student's food haven. come if you're craving japanese-style ramen or some hearty char-siu. take bus 17 or, if desperate enough, it's just a 20 min run!

#### coco ichibanya
not somewhere i'd go back to a second time. the pork cutlet curry definitely didn't live up to my expectations... which was disappointing because i'd been wanting to try coco for the *longest* time. conclusion: come for smexy instagram food pics, don't if you want yummy food down your tummy.

#### chinchikurin
got the GOAM, tan tan men, and chinchikurinyaki (i think)! didn't taste as delicious as it looked; was rather flavorless but this is the only okonomiyaki spot nearby so i'll give it points for its uniqueness.

#### dongting noodle
now, this has gotta be one of my favorite noodle places in sawtelle. they say third time's the charm, but man, that original beef noodle soup hit straight home from the very first slurp i took. it was unforgettable. everything from the noods, to the juicy cuts of beef, to the hot savory soup base was perfect. that is to say, don't order the braised red beef noodles because they aren't as good.

#### killer noodle tsujita
came here with my lovely tasa fam~ noodles were mid though. got the original soup noodle w/ level 3 spice and it felt like i was eating just ramen for how flavorless everything was lol. maybe the dry noodles are better? or maybe it just wasn't spicy enough? solid 4/10.

#### tsujita la
literally SO good. like SO good. came for the first time w my roomies and we ordered the original soup noodles, original tsukemen, and salmon rice bowl. the tsukemen was served as a bowl of dry noodles with charsiu and dipping soup base to the side. the charsiu was so fat and juicy, and the noodles were perfectly cooked, on par with mogu mogu's mazemen.

        <h4>mogu mogu</h4>
        <p>yummy mazemen! the bowl portion is kinda small but the noodles, toppings, and sauce are just delicious goodness all around. came here for many club socials (blueprint, creative labs) and the tokyo/kyoto never disappoint.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
        <h4>marugame udon</h4>
        <p>standard solid udon for a cheap price (roughly $10)! you can add shrimp and veggie tempura for a few extra dollars. overall, nothing too special about this place. it's somewhere i'd go as a regular if i lived nearby.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
        <h4>seoul tofu</h4>
        <p>came here for valentine's day dinner with a friend xD. tbh the banchan was the highlight, and the main beef/pork tofu soups were pretty mid (meat was dry and a little sour). overall a good place for comfort food and hot soup cravings!</p>

### ktown, la (nom nom)
where all the homies go for good kbbq, club food socials, and just delicious korean food in general. tofu soup, bibimbap, fish and rice cakes, mandus, tteokbokki, you name it, ktown has it :p

#### yup dduk la

huge bowls of heavenly cheese and tteokboki!! one bowl is enough for 3 people, and it also comes with a cute mini make-your-own onigiri side. you'll only like this place if you're particularly into rice cakes or craving them immensely.

#### mdk noodles
came here with some friends after going cafe hopping hehe! :heart: got the dumpling and rice cake soup, and they immediately served us platters of kimchi when we sat down (green flag GREEN FLAG!!). everything is around $18 which is kinda pricey but worth~
