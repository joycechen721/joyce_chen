*lmao just very very random thoughts i write down sometimes*

### thoughts pt.4
- being in groups kinda forces you to keep coming up with witty responses which is super tiring. it always boils down to one main storyteller and everyone else trying so hard to insert a grand reaction or witty statement at climactic points during their storytelling. from what i’ve noticed group conversations always reach a point where everyone is just throwing around random isolated statements that are funny but meaningless and idk… brain-dead??? lol.

### thoughts pt.3
- it takes a while for food to make you feel full. so don’t stuff yourself all at once, because you’ll feel insanely bloated afterwards. your body has a delayed response for fullness, so don’t be greedy and eat so much as it’s backfire and make you feel sick instead.
- google maps is not reliable. your instinct and sense of direction can work  wonders.
- with happiness comes despair. we try despair comes happiness. none of the two last an eternity. and that is what makes life fun to live.
- books are therapeutic and the most efficient way to obtain knowledge. you’re absorbing the work and thoughts of the author in 1/1000th the time it took for him/her to compile them! sound it up for reading, please.
- human interaction really comes down to sharing our experiences: the only thing we truly talk about is our experiences... there’s really nothing else! more knowledge = more experience = more sharing of ideas.

### thoughts pt.2
- everything will add up. the skills and experiences you think irrelevant will show their use in that one unexpected opportunity that requires them.
- talent and brains don’t determine everything. it’s how much dedication, passion, and willfulness you put into a subject. anything is capable of mastering, as long as you invest time and effort into it. 
- don’t look at other peoples goods so much that you lose your own vision. this life is yours. instead of constantly comparing yourself on whether you’re fast enough, high enough, better enough, focus on creating meaningful experiences and impact. that’s what will get you far in the long run.
- imposter syndrome is bullshit. fuck that. i’m capable. i have potential. i can fucking do that as well, as long as i put effort into it. 
- health is the most important. when you’re 90 years old, are you gonna look back and think, dang i should’ve had a skinnier body? i should’ve ate less?
- in general, people look back on their lives regretting what they didn’t do, more than what they did do.
- my dad is the strongest person i know. almost 60 years old, but still amazing, active, strong both mentally and physically. everyday i’m surprised by how mature and thoughtful he is towards life: i can’t imagine being holed up with a family for 20+ years, but he did it. he cooks, does all our chores, and basically runs the family despite being tough on me sometimes. i really admire him, and i’m just starting to understand why. i am proud of my dad. 
- stress is accumulated by poor time management and laziness. it means lingering in a constant state of worry and betting your future on pure luck instead of hard work. that’s why you should spend your time perfecting your skills, or doing things that will help you reach your goal because then, your vision will be crystal clear. you’ll become confident knowing that you have the ability to obtain your future. create your own future. know what you want, work towards it, make yourself unbeatable and a professional in the skills required for your goal, and charge forward.
    - constantly worrying about how well others are doing? how “talented” they are in a certain area and how you wish to be like them, have their “talents”? what you don’t realize is the amount of work and time they put into perfecting their “talent.”  they aren’t born “talented” most of the time so stop thinking that they are. that’s not only disrespecting them, but also encouraging a toxic “fixed mindset.” so instead of worrying your ass off everyday, why don’t you start doing whatever you want to do as well? become *that* person. live for yourself, and live for your honor. don’t live feeling envious of others, because you are capable of achieving the same things if you work just as hard. or twice as hard. see other people as inspiration, but not as objects of envy. and how do you achieve this? you do the same — work just as hard, put in time, dedication, effort, and heart into shaping the future you desire. and leave the rest to luck, because you already tried your very best :) 越努力越幸運!
    - in conclusion: skills defeat stress. hard work brings satisfaction and confidence. 
- friends are so precious yet so fleeting. people connect so easily, yet drift apart just as easily. i wonder why that is? are we afraid that people we latch onto would hurt ultimately hurt us the most if they wanted to, or are human beings naturally creatures who desire social quantity over quality? 
- why is it that i’m always so scared of expressing myself?
- why do ponder and regret decisions when there’s no turning back anyways?

### thoughts pt.1
- actions > thoughts/beliefs/words
- don’t be afraid to tread in new waters. take on a challenge. you will grow so much, and nothing is as bad as it seems in your mind. so stop worrying. we all got this. bread.
- forgive, don’t take revenge but also don’t forget 
- you may be selfish even when you don’t realize it
- taking on challenges can bring personal growth and a sense of accomplishment 
- stepping out of your comfort zone isn’t that bad
- just do it. if you don’t want to procrastinate, then just do your work. just do your work however much you don’t feel like it, and soon you’ll get it over with
- stop comparing and being jealous of other people. it really doesn’t matter. people who you look up to probably feel average themselves. just live your life and continuously self improve. be happy. care about others.
- life is actually harder than it seems.
- you can only find your true passion when you don’t give a shit about it. don’t think, “i need to find my passion.” instead, just do whatever makes you happy and go with the flow. you will find your passion soon enough. besides, what’s the point of a “passion” if you are already living happily??

### to learn pt.1
- how to remain grateful despite feeling annoyed and frustrated at the moment- i honestly don’t know if i’m grateful enough to my parents because i feel so mad and frustrated at them but at the same time i know i should appreciate their work and all...i need some space to think
- how to be more patient and unselfish

### questions. 
- why is it that the people closest to us, most caring towards us, cause us the most pain and sadness?
- why do we easily idolize strangers, instead of those close around us? because we don’t see their flaws?
- can individualism go too far? these days, it seems like everyone is independent and voicing their own opinions without a problem. but would that come off as selfish? is caring/individualizing yourself a sign of not caring for others?

### quotes
- “You can take me as the direction and goal of your efforts, but you must follow your own path. Do not compare with others. Do not imitate anyone.” — Cai Xukun
- “Because it was our first time, we were able to risk it all over fluttering hearts.” — Dear.M
- “Just like lyrics that seem to be about my life, and like poetry that seems to be about my feelings,  ‘Dear.M’ was a love letter to all of us. Maybe we just needed an excuse?” — Dear.M
- “I’ve lived my entire life preparing for this role. This life is the only life I’ve ever dreamt of. And now it is my reality. I do not want to throw my life away simply because my husband is making my life difficult.” — Navier, Remarried Empress
- “People love heroes, but they love seeing their downfall even more. That woman [Rashta] is in a position to sway public opinion for her own personal interests. But I can’t do that. I am the empress. I must think about the empire and its people. No matter which of us the public thinks is the villain, the people will think the emperor is a spineless man who is easily manipulated by others. They’ll lose respect for him.” — Navier, Remarried Empress
- “And those insignificant decisions we make come back to us in the future as regret.” — While You Were Sleeping
- “We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate.” — Victor E. Frankl
- “…we could say that most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge. One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.” — Victor E. Frankl
- “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how” — Nietzsche
